/* to do app
- write users stories
- break first feature down in to steps
- make first feature
- make todo app

1. make a list - a) make a js file,
                          b) data model - it is going to be an array of string(todo items),
                          c) iterate over array and log,
                          d) find out what method to use to write it,(create element, append)
                          e) write our data to the DOM: - select the list <ul>
                                                        - append child to ul

2. add items to the list - a) create input field
                           b) create function x to take input value
                           c) onclick/onsubmit (tied to a form/button) event listener to run f(x)
                           d) add item to a list of to-todo
                           e) run display function
3. check the item off the list
- you always have to break your problem into smaller steps
